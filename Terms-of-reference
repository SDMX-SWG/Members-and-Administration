**SDMX Statistical Working Group (SWG) - Terms of Reference**

SDMX sponsoring organisations wish to increase and formalise the participation of the SDMX User Community (statistical offices, central banks and other national and international organisations dealing with statistics) in the management and development of the SDMX statistical guidelines. The SDMX Statistical Working Group (SWG) is meant to provide the forum for this active participation.

_ **Mandate and process** _

1. The SDMX SWG manages the statistical guidelines (including the Content-Oriented Guidelines) on behalf of the SDMX Sponsors and the SDMX User Community.
2. The SWG reports through the SDMX Secretariat to the SDMX Sponsors, and coordinates its activities with the SDMX Secretariat and the SDMX Technical Working Group (TWG).
3. Based on input from the User Community, the SWG focuses on improving and extending the SDMX statistical guidelines, in particular with regard to those that are common across statistical domains.
4. In agreement with the SDMX Sponsors and the SDMX Secretariat, the SWG defines its work programme. This work programme is made publicly available, with regular updates as necessary. However,new items for inclusion on that work programme and/or re-prioritisation of existing items can be suggested by the SDMX community.
5. Based on the work programme, the SWG prepares proposals for revised versions of the SDMX statistical guidelines or other SDMX related artefacts falling under its competence. The SDMX Secretariat and the TWG are informed at the start of the work and consulted as necessary during the work. Following this consultation period, proposals that have the consensus of the SWG members are submitted to the SDMX Secretariat for approval. The SDMX Secretariat immediately assigns a deadline for comments and response on the proposals. Upon expiry of the deadline for the (written) procedure and public consultation, and dependent on feedback received, the SWG may revise the proposal. If the SDMX Secretariat and the SWG then reach a consensus on the consolidated proposal, the final document is made publicly available (and accordingly versioned in case of SDMX artefacts).
6. The consultations may also lead to the addition of items to the work programme and/or re-prioritisation of existing items.
7. All information about the SWG and its activities (including public consultations) is published on a dedicated page of SDMX.org website to increase awareness among the SDMX User Community about the deliverables of the SWG.

_ **Membership** _

8. Membership of the SWG is open to:

- Representatives of the SDMX sponsor organisations.
- Representatives of national statistical offices, national central banks or other national and international organisations dealing with the production of official statistics.
- Individual SDMX experts (from organisations other than those mentioned in the two preceding points) with proven contributions to the development of the SDMX standard and/or to its implementation.

9. Membership to the SWG is subject to the following constraints:

- An organisation will have a seat in the SWG and can nominate a maximum of two representatives, full member and alternate member. Both members have a say in the meetings, but each seat counts for one vote.
- At least three SDMX Sponsor organizations should be represented in the SWG at any meeting.
- Membership of the SWG is limited to a maximum of 25 seats to keep it efficient and functional.
- The number of individual SDMX experts appointed as members of the SWG should never represent more than a 20% of the total number of seats of the SWG.
- Each member is responsible for communicating with subject-matter experts in their institutions on SWG proposals during the review process, and to disseminate the information when a proposal is published.

10. Members of the SWG are expected to provide around one person-month per year for SWG-related activities.

11. The SWG may invite non-member experts to its (virtual or physical) meetings as observers in cases where expertise in a specific area is needed.

12. Each Member is expected to actively contribute in the activities of the SWG. Active contribution implies participation to virtual and physical meetings and contributions to task forces and projects. The Secretariat, in consultation with the Chair, may request a member to withdraw if such requirements are not respected.

13. Every two years, or in case of less than 15 seats being occupied in the SWG, the SDMX Secretariat will launch an open call for membership applications to the SWG. Spontaneous requests for membership may also be sent at any time to the SDMX Secretariat (secretariat@sdmx.org). In order to keep a good balance between new and senior members in the SWG, a maximum of 7 seats will be renewed every two years.

14. The SDMX Secretariat reviews and either approves or rejects membership requests. A geographical and organisational balance of participation should be ensured to the extent possible.

15. The list of members of the SWG is made publicly available on sdmx.org.

_ **Operational Procedures** _

16. The SWG meets physically up to two times per year depending on the needs. Participation to meetings of the SWG will be at participants' organisations own cost. Virtual meetings should be held on a regular basis. Additional meetings can also be organised should a need for these arise.

17. The SWG designates a chair and deputy chair with a term of office of two years. Serving multiple terms is possible. When circumstances allow, the preference is for a national organisation member as chair, and an international organisation member as co-chair. In case the SWG is unable to designate a chair and/or deputy chair from its current members, the Secretariat may issue an open call for the position. Preference for a suitable candidate for chairing the SWG will be given to a current or former member of any of the governance bodies (TWG, SWG, Secretariat, Sponsorsâ€™ Committee) membership term of at least 2 years. Further requirements are defined in the specific Terms of Reference for the SWG Chair.

18. The SWG operates and prepares its proposals on a consensus basis and defines its detailed working procedures as required.

19. The SWG uses a technical collaboration platform to undertake the tasks in its work programme. The funding for this infrastructure, which should be shared with the TWG, should be agreed by the SDMX sponsors.

20. Specific tasks may be delegated to, or undertaken jointly with, other members of the statistical community, as necessary. Specific tasks can also be outsourced to consultants, subject to funding agreements with the SDMX sponsors or other members of the SDMX community.
